Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suso ga nureta nara
kawaku no mateba ii
mizu oto wo tatete haneta
			If the cuffs of my pants get wet,
			I can just wait until they dry.
			Making sounds in the water, I jumped in.
			
kimi ga oshiete kuretanda mou kowakunai
nigitte ite kureta kono te wo hasanakya dame da
			You taught me this. I'm not afraid anymore.
			I have to let go of this hand that was holding on to mine.
			
hitori demo yuku yo tatoe tsurakutemo
minna de mita yume ha kanarazu motteku yo
minna to ga ii na minna to ga yokatta
demo mezameta asa dare mo inainda ne
			Even alone, I'll go on, even if it's painful.
			I'll definitely take along the dream I saw with you.
			It's nice to be with everyone; I was glad to be with everyone.
			...But in the morning I woke up to, none of you are there.
			
mou furikaettemo dare no kage mo nai
mizu tamari dake ga hikatta
ikiteku koto sore wa tachimukatte iku koto
sore ga wakatta nara ato wa fumidasu yuuki dake
			If I look back now, not even a shadow is there.
			Only a small pool of water was shining.
			To live on is to stand and fight.
			Once you understand that, all you need is the courage to step forward.
			
doko made mo yuku yo koko de shitta koto
shiawase to iu yume wi kanaete miseru yo
minna to hanaretemo donna ni tooku nattemo
atarashii asa ni kono boku wa ikiru yo
			I'll go anywhere with the things that I learned here.
			I'll show that I can make the dream called happiness come true.
			Even if we're apart, no matter how far apart we become,
			I will live on in a new morning.
			
hitori demo yuku yo shinitaku nattemo
koe ga kikoeru yo shinde wa ikenai to
tatoe tsurakutemo yami ni tozasaretemo
kokoro no oku ni wa akari ga tomotteru yo
			Even alone, I'll go on. Even if I start to want to die,
			I'll hear your voice telling me that I must not die.
			Even if it's painful, even if darkness closes me in,
			Deep in my heart, the lights will remain bright.
			
megutte nagarete toki wa utsuroida
mou nani ga atta ka omoidasenai kedo
me wo tojite mireba minna no waraigoe
naze ka sore ga ima ichiban no takaramono
			Turning and flowing along, time is transient.
			What happened then? I can't remember,
			But if I try closing my eyes, I hear everyone's laughing voices.
			For some reason, that is now my most precious treasure.
