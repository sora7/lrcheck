Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
itsumo hitori de aruiteta furikaeru to minna ha tooku
soredemo atashi ha aruita sore ga tsuyosa datta
mou nani mo kowaku nai sou tsubuyaite miseru
itsuka hito ha hitori ni natte omoide no naka ni ikiteku dake
kodoku sae aishi waratterareru you ni atashi ha tatakaun da
namida nante misenain da
			I have always walked alone. When I looked back, everyone was faraway
			Even so, I kept walking. That was my strength
			"I'm not afraid of anything anymore", I muttered to myself
			Everyone will be alone someday, living on in memories only
			I fight so that I will be able to love and laugh despite of the loneliness
			I won't show my tears
			
itsumo hitori de aruiteta ikusaki ni ha gake ga matteta
soredemo atashi ha aruita tsuyosa no shoumei no tame
fukitsukeru tsuyoi kaze ase de SHATSU ga haritsuku
itsuka wasurete shimaeru nara ikiru koto sore ha tayasui mono
boukyaku no kanata he to ochiteiku nara sore ha nigeru koto darou
ikita imi sura kieru darou
			I have always walked alone. The cliff was waiting for me ahead
			Even so, I kept walking, to prove my strength
			The strong wind blew against me. My shirt stuck to me with sweat
			If I can forget everything one day, being alive will be so easy 
			If I fall into the other side of oblivion, that means I am running away
			Even the meaning of having lived will disappear
			
kaze ha yagate naideta ase mo kawaite
onaka ga suitekita na nani ka attakke
nigiyaka na koe to tomo ni ii nioi ga yattekita
			The wind had soon calmed down. My sweat had also dried out
			I became hungry. What was that?
			A nice smell came together with lively voices
			
itsumo hitori de aruiteta minna ga matteita
			I have always walked alone. Everyone was waiting
			
itsuka hito ha hitori ni natte omoide no naka ni ikuteku dake
soredemo ii yasuraka na kono kimochi ha sore wo nakama to yobun da
itsuka minna to sugoshita hibi mo wasurete dokoka de ikiteru yo
sono toki ha mou tsuyoku nanka nai yo
futsuu no onnanoko no yowasa de namida wo kobosu yo
			Everyone will be alone someday, living on in memories only
			Even so, it's fine. I call this peaceful feeling my friend
			Someday I will be living somewhere, with the memories of days spent with everyone left behind
			At that time I won't be strong anymore
			I will just be sobbing like a weak ordinary girl
