Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
boroboro no mama de moufu ni taore
doushite konna ni mukininatteru n darou
futo yogitta
			Going to pieces, I fall onto my blanket.
			Why am I taking it so seriously?
			Suddenly, the thought came by.
			
nobotte mita toki hirogaru sekai wa chiisai hodo kimochi ii
dakara mubou na hodo takai kabe ga ii
daremo ga miageru youna  sono hou ga atashi rashii
			When I tried climbing up, the spreading world made me feel better as it got smaller,
			So I want a wall so high that it would be reckless to climb it.
			It's like everyone is looking up at me. That would be true to who I am.
			
nakanaka netsukenai yoru wa
kuriimu no koro no kuraputon o hiitari suru no ga suki
Down to the crossroads!
			On the nights when I can't fall asleep,
			I like playing Clapton's music from Cream's days.
			Down to the crossroads!
			
ikite mite mo ii  sou omoetara kara
umarete kita hazu desho?
yappa yokatta na  hito tte utsukushii na  sou omoeru basho ni ima
konpasu o awaseteru
			"I can try living on." Since I was able to think that,
			It was right for me to be born, right?
			I'm glad, after all, that I'm in a place where I can think that humans are beautiful now.
			The compasses are lining up.
			
sorya kanashii toki wa naku yo
hitoribocchi wa samishii yo
demo ne ningen tte sonna mon da yo?
Oh, my guitar hibike !
			Of course, I cry at sad times;
			Being by myself is lonely,
			But isn't that what it is to be human?
			Oh, my guitar, resound!
			
nobotte mita toki hirogaru sekai wa chiisai hodo kimochi ii
dakara mubou na hodo takai houga ii
daremo ga miageru youna  kimi mo dou?
ikite yokatta na  sou omoeta nara
saikou ni kimochi ii
boroboro ni naite mo  mogaite sakende mo
soredemo atashi tachi wa mata aruki daseru n da ne
sayonara to, arigatou
			When I tried climbing up, the spreading world made me feel better as it got smaller,
			So the more reckless the height, the better it is.
			It's like everyone is looking up at me. How about you?
			"I'm glad I'm alive." If you could think like that,
			You'd have the greatest feeling.
			Even if we're falling apart and crying, even if we're struggling and screaming,
			Even so, we can start walking again.
			Goodbye, and thank you.
			
LaLaLaLa Happy life! Go!
LaLaLaLa Take me with you!
LaLaLaLa Highest life! Go!
LaLaLaLa Go with me!
			LaLaLaLa, Happy life! Go!
			LaLaLaLa, Take me with you!
			LaLaLaLa, Highest life! Go!
			LaLaLaLa, Go with me!
