Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mugen ni ikitai mugen ni ikiraretara subete kanau
demo ironna mono ga atashi o oikondeku
ikiru nokori jikan yume no zahyou yukue
zenbu daiji na mono na no ni
ii sa kokora de chotto amai mono tabeteiko
sou iu shikouteishi bakari tokui ni natta
			I want to live forever. If I could live forever, everything would come true,
			But various things drive me into a corner.
			The time I have left to live, the coordinates of my dream, the place where I am -
			They're all important things.
			All right, let's stay here for a little and eat something sweet.
			When I just stopped thinking like that, I became proud.
			
aruitekita michi furikaeru to 
iya na koto bakkari demo uunzari da yo
fureru mono o kagayakashiteyuku 
sonna michi o ikitekitakatta yo
			When I look back at the road I walked down,
			I get fed up with how it's nothing but things I didn't want.
			Letting the things I touch shine
			that kind of path is the kind I wanted to live.
			
mushou ni ikitai asette bakari no hibi subete kiesou
demo sabotte mo miru datte tsukarechau ja nai sonna mujun shikou
atashi atama dokka shiranai uchiutta mitai da
ikka kokora de chotto byouin e ittokou
zutto okiterareru kusuri wa oitemasen ka?
			I desperately want to live. All of the days that rushed by look like they'll disappear,
			But I'll try skipping class, so I shouldn't be getting tiredmy thoughts are inconsistent like that.
			It's like my head was hit somewhere when I wasn't aware.
			Okay, let's go to the hospital from here for a little while.
			Could you leave me some medicine that'll keep me awake forever?
			
bosaa to tsuttatteru dake de mou 
kaseki ni natteshimaisou na nda yo
dare kara mo wasurerareta you na 
kusunda sonzai ni natteshimau yo
			Just by standing up quickly,
			I feel like I'm going to turn into a fossil.
			As though it was forgotten by everyone,
			my existence is darkening.
			
ii sa kokora de chotto konjou o miseteyaru
jibun de hoo tataite sonzai no shoumei e
			All right, let's stay here for a little, and I'll show you my spirit.
			Slap yourself on the cheeks as proof that you exist.
			
aruitekita michi furikaeranai 
iya na koto bakkari demo mae e susume
fureru mono o kagayakashiteyuku 
sonna sonzai ni nattemiseru yo
miseru yo (3x)
			I won't look back at the road I walked down.
			It's all things I didn't want, but move on forward.
			Letting the things I touch shine 
			I'll become that kind of existence.
			I'll show you that!
