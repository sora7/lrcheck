Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
warau koto mo gara ja nakute sumashite kiiteta
hoozue o tsuite gogo no kensou
yukkuri to chikazuite kie
kasanaru hamon no you na hitotachi o zutto mitekita
sukoshi demo tsutawattara koko ni iru imi ga tsukureru
soto wa ame kyoushitsu de kyoku o kaiteta
			With laughter being out of my character, I was listening carefully,
			With my chin in my hands, to the noise of the afternoon.
			As they slowly approach and then disappear,
			I've just been watching the people that are like so many ripples.
			If it would be conveyed even a little, I could write the meaning for why we're here.
			With rain outside, I wrote my song inside the classroom.
			
waratte sa nakisakende sa yuke daremo
koko de ima sore o utau kara
tanoshisou ni umaku waratte yo tsuzuki ga detekonai
soto wa mou hareta kedo atashi wa koko ni iru
			Laugh; cry and shout; go on, all of you.
			That's what I'm singing here and now.
			Laugh as well as you can, like you're having fun. The continuation won't come out here.
			It's already cleared up outside, but I'm here.
			
dandan minaretekita hibi
kaketeiku nakama koronde wa minna ni warawareteiru
akireru hodo ni heion de ikiisoida kako ni
kitto tsukareteta zutto yasundetai
kono mama mo waruku nai
demo sore ja nanimo nase wa shinai
imi no aru seikatsu ni kaetemisetai
			I've gradually gotten used to seeing these days.
			Friends run along; when one falls down, everyone else laughs.
			The shockingly peaceful past that we rushed our lives through
			Must have been tiring. I want to rest forever...
			Things aren't bad like this,
			But that way, I won't achieve anything.
			I want to turn this into a life with a meaning.
			
waratte sa nakisakende sa yuke atashi mo
koko de ima sakendeiru kara
donna fuu ni kanjou koboshitara koko kara kierareru
donna fuu ni yurushitara ano hibi o aiseru
			Laugh; cry and shout; go on; I will, too.
			That's what I'm shouting here and now.
			In what way do I need to spill my feelings so that I can disappear from here?
			In what way do I need to forgive so that I can love those days?
			
"tsuyoku nareru to omou futari dattara"
sonna kotoba ga yowai daremo hitori da
aki no sasu you na kaze ga hontou ni itai
arukihajimeta ashi ga mou mae e denai
arigatou o iwanai sonna tsuyosa ga hoshii
nanimo iwazu ni yuku sube itsuka mi ni tsukeru
koko kara arukidasu subete no tamashii ni
kami no shukufuku yo are God bless you
			"I think we can become stronger if we're together."
			Words like that are weak - everyone is alone.
			The autumn wind that seems to pierce through me is truly painful.
			The legs that began to walk won't move forward anymore.
			I want the strength to not say, "Thank you."
			Someday, I'll learn how to go on without saying anything.
			I'll start walking from here into all of the souls.
			May God's blessings come to you. God bless you!
			
waratte sa nakisakende sa yuku toki ni
hitori dake tachitsukushiteita
hitori dake mou sukoshi dake tatou waraou
ano hi to wa mata chigau hibi e
			Laugh; cry and shout; when it's time for you to go.
			I was standing completely still, all alone.
			All alone, for just a little longer, I'll cry, I'll laugh,
			On my way to days different from that one.
