Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mezamashidokei ga ga naritateteru
onegai mou sukoshi nemurasete
kinou wa GIG de sono ato nomikai de
mochiron osake wa nomenai nda kedo juusu na nda kedo
isogashii hibi o majime ni ikiru
kono atashime ni douka nemuri o
chanto okitara shinkyoku kikaseteageru
mochiron hikigatari de hamori wa onegai
tetoriashitori oshieteageru yo shinpainai
sou iya ichigen kireteta kattekite onegai!
			The alarm clock is ringing loudly in my ears.
			Please, let me sleep for a little more.
			At the drinking party after yesterday's gig,
			I couldn't drink alcohol, of course, but I had juice. Still...
			I'm living seriously through busy days.
			So somehow, let this kind of me sleep...
			When I actually get up, I'll let you hear the new song.
			Of course, when I sing and play, the harmony is all yours.
			I'll teach you as attentively as I can, so don't you worry.
			Ah, right, I broke a string. Go out and buy some, please!
			
mezamashidokei o tomete kara sanjuppun
ii kagen okinakya ikenai kedo
mafuyu no ofuton wa mashou no aitemu
mou nukedasenaku natteshimatta yo nemuri noroi tsuki
warera ga kurasu gendai shakai
konna tokoro ni akuma ga ita
kudaranai kara isshou ni fusu nante hidoku nai?
koko kara omoshiroku naru ka mo shirenai ja nai
dakara tsuzuki to iwarete mo mada ukandenai
toriaezu futon ni taberare futonman ni naru
mou sore de ii ja nai
			It's been half an hour since I stopped the alarm clock.
			I really have to get it together and get up, though.
			A futon in midwinter is a devilish item.
			I just can't get out of it now. This thing has a sleeping curse on it.
			In the modern society that we live in,
			There was a demon in this place.
			I'm good for nothing, so I put on a smile  isn't that terrible?
			Maybe from here, things will get more interesting, right?
			That's why even though I was told to continue, I haven't come up.
			For now, I'll get eaten by the futon and become a futon bun.
			Now, isn't that nice?
			
haihai sorosoro okimasu yo oyu o wakashite yo
nemukezamashi no koohii ni tabenokoshita kukkii o
sou iya shinkyoku no renshuu o suru ndattakke na
somosomo hitorigurashi de dare to hanashiteta ndaro?

			Okay, okay, I'll get up soon. Heat the bath for me.
			I'll put my half-eaten cookie in my wake-up coffee.
			Ah, right, I was going to practice the new song, wasn't I?
			Anyway, who have I been talking to when I live alone?
