Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ah sukoshi no aida mattekurenai ka
ah dokoka de yobu koe ga suru nda
			Ah, could you wait for just a while?
			Ah, I can hear someone calling my name somewhere.
			
"itsuka wa daisutaa
urekko myuujishan
sonna yume miru yori wa
minai hou ga mashi darou
dareka kawari ni okkakete kure
boku wa hitori de muryoku o daiteru yo"
			"Someday you'll be a big star,
			A popular musician.
			Rather than having that dream
			Wouldn't it be better not to have it?
			Someone chase it for me instead.
			Alone, I embrace my powerlessness."
			
furueteru sorujaa
sonna kimi ni mo
kono kumo o saite
hikari ga sasu you utatteageru kara
sabitsuita gen o tatakitsuke
			A shivering soldier
			When you're like that,
			Pull apart those clouds
			Because I'll sing so the light gets to you
			Strumming these rusted strings.
			
"itsuka wa daihatsumei
Nooberu jushou mon
sonna boroi yume wa tou ni sutetekita
sumikko no hou ni korogatteru kara
karenai teido ni mizu wa yatteru yo"
			"Someday you'll have an invention breakthrough
			That's Nobel Prize material.
			I've already thrown out such worn-out dreams
			Because it's falling into the cracks
			If I could make it not wither, I'd water it."
			
utsumuita sorujaa
sonna kimi ni wa
furaseyou kokoro no
daichi ni ame o
itsu no hi ka kogane no hana o
sakasete kaze ni yureru yo
			Eyes casting-down soldier
			When you're like that,
			Let's let the rain
			Fall in your heart.
			Someday, a gold flower
			Will bloom, and sway in the wind.
			
"hitori ja nemurenai yoru mo aru kedo
dareka ga ireba sore ni yatsuatari de
			"There are nights I can't sleep alone, but
			If someone's there, I'll get angry at that.
			
nante nasakenai
ikiteru koto ga fukou de
konna boku nante daremo hitsuyou to shitenai nda
isso kieteshimae yo"
			How pathetic.
			Living is so unfortunate
			No one needs someone like me.
			I should just disappear."
			
ah sonna no atashi datte onaji sa
ah ikiteiku no wa muzukashii na
ah dakara uta o kiite hoshii nda
ah kimi dake ni utau uta da kara
			Ah, I'm like that too.
			Ah, it's hard to live, huh.
			Ah, that's why I want you to listen to my song.
			Ah, because I'm only singing for you.
			
demo mou ikanakucha
nagai wa dekinai nda
yakusoku o nokoshite, koko ni kiteru kara
dakara saigo no uta ni naru yo
sukoshi demo chikara ni naru to ii na
			But I have to go now.
			I can't make this long
			Because I've come here to leave a promise behind.
			So this'll be my Last Song.
			It'd be great if it helped you, even a bit.
			
daremo ga sorujaa
yume miru sorujaa
soratakaku hoero
jishin no nasa wa sono mama de ii nda yo
atashi ga shinjiteageru zutto
			Everyone's a soldier
			A dreaming soldier
			Howl up the sky above
			It's fine for you not to have self-confidence
			Because I'll believe in you forever.
			
ah youyaku futarikiri ni nareta na
ah omae no uta mo kikasete kure
			Ah, finally, it's just you and me.
			Ah, let me hear your song too.
