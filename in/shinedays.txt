Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kinou mita yume wa mou wasureteshimatta kedo
kono kodou wa mada dokidoki shiteru yo
poketto ni arittake no koin o tsumekondemiru
kakato o narashi semai heya o deyou
			I've already forgotten the dream I had yesterday,
			But my heart is still beating so fast.
			I'll try cramming all of the coins into my pocket.
			Let's click our heels and get out of this cramped room.
			
saa hashirinukero kinou to kyou mada minu mirai e to go!
kakumei o okoshi ni ikou yume o kanae ni ikou
kakedashitara doko made mo ikou
Ainshutain no riron mo bukkowashite tsukisusumou
			Come on, run on through yesterday and today. To the future we haven't seen yet, go!
			Let's go start a revolution. Let's go make our dreams come true!
			Once we run out there, let's go anywhere.
			Let's break down Einstein's theories and push on forward.
			
aru hareta hi ni deatta tabibito wa itta
kono saki ni wa areta daichi da kedo
sonna koto yori kono dorodarake no kutsu o
aratteyaritai zutto issho da kara
			A traveler I met on a sunny day said
			That past here, there's only a vast wasteland.
			More importantly, I want to wash these mud-covered shoes
			Because we're always together.
			
saa koko kara wa jibun to no shoubu tatoe hitori demo grow!
itsu made mo kids no mama ja onaka ga suichau yo
dekireba kokoro no mama ni ikou ookina chizu o egakou
hate wa atashitachi shidai mugendai da yo
			Come on, from here, it's a contest with yourself. Even if it's with yourself, you'll grow!
			We'll always get hungry just like kids!
			If we can, let's follow our hearts. Let's draw great map.
			The end depends on us -- it's infinite.
			
donna hi ga kite mo itsu demo kono kobushi o kazashite
I'm a sunshine kumo no kirema kara sashikomu yo
yawaraka na beam!
			No matter what kind of day comes, I'll hold up this fist.
			I am sunshine, shining through the gaps in the clouds -
			A soft and gentle beam!
			
oiteku yo guzu na yatsu wa
sugusoko ni shouki no yokan
			Indecisive people will be left behind.
			Right over there, I'll predict our chances of winning.
			
saa hashirinukero kinou to kyou mada minu mirai e to go!
kakumei o okoshi ni iku yo? Are you ready to go, baby?
kimetara mou mayowazu ni iku yo
Ainshutain no riron mo bukkowashite tsukisusumu
atashitachi wa minna dazzling sunshine
ikou monster sunshine
kutte kakatteyaru nda
we are sunshine kumo no kirema kara sasu
yume o kanaeru hikari shine days
			Come on, run on through yesterday and today. To the future we haven't seen yet, go!
			We're going to start a revolution. Are you ready to go, baby?
			If we're all sure, we'll go with no confusion in our minds.
			We'll break down Einstein's theories and push on forward.
			We are all dazzling sunshine!
			Let's go, monster sunshine!
			I'll get you all fired up!
			We are sunshine, shining through the gaps in the clouds -
			Light that can make dreams come true. Shine days!
