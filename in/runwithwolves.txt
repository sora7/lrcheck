Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
every night otozureru itami o kishikishi kishimu beddo no ue de taete
nani ga machigatteita no ka are mo kore mo koukai no nen ni kararemakuru
			Every night, I endure the pain that visits me on top of the squeaking, creaking bed.
			Did I get something wrong? Thinking about this and that, I wallow in feelings of regret.
			
"ima no mama ja dame ni naru ne" to dare ga itta no ka mo wakaranaku naru
			"The way it is now, it's no good." I don't know who said that anymore.
			
mou hitori de ikiteiku shika nai to moeyuku kouya o mitsume
kizu o otta ookami no you ni wa yeah! kieteikitaku nai madamada
sore nara taoreta hou ga mashi da kara
			With the thought that all I can do now is live on alone, I gaze at the burning wasteland.
			Like a wolf that endured its wounds, yeah, I don't want to disappear, not yet,
			Because if I did, it would've been better if I'd fallen.
			
Friday otozureru shuumatsu souzen to shita heya mo katazukanai
sukoshi nobita tsume o kande terebi o miteru mou nan demo yoku nattekuru
arukooru o atama kara abita kore de yoeru nara mada raku na no ni
			On Friday, as the weekend visits, I won't tidy up this noisy room.
			Biting my nails that have grown a little long, I watch TV. At this point, everything starts to look good.
			I bathed myself in alcohol from the head down. If I could get drunk from this, I'd keep on feeling good.
			
mou mukashi no you ni waraenai koto o kanashii koto da to omowanai
tada daremo ga erandeiku koto na no ka konna kurushii koto na no ni
sore nara nigeta hou ga mashi na no ni
			I don't think of the way that I can't laugh like I used to as a sad thing.
			Is this just something that everyone chooses, even though it hurts so much?
			In that case, it would've been better if I'd run away.
			
dame ni narisou yogen doori da
yoku nai souzou nante haite wa sutero!
			It looks like I'm going to fail, just as I predicted.
			I'll just throw away the bad thoughts when I spit them out!
			
mou hitori de ikiteiku shika nai to moeyuku kouya o mitsume
kizu o otta ookami no you ni wa yeah! kieteikitaku nai madamada
mou ano hi no you ni waraenai koto o kanashii koto da to omowanai
kouya kakeru ookami wa ima mo mada furikaeru koto mo nai
sore nara saki o isogou run with wolves

			With the thought that all I can do now is live on alone, I gaze at the burning wasteland.
			Like a wolf that endured its wounds, yeah, I don't want to disappear, not yet.
			I don't think of the way that I can't laugh like I did that day as a sad thing.
			The wolf that runs through the wasteland still doesn't look back even now.
			In that case, let's hurry ahead and run with wolves!
