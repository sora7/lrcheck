Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
futari no aida ni wa iroiro atta
shumi no chigai ni tomo ni souji shinai
ryouri wa omae ga kokufuku shiro to
sonna ippouteki na meirei o kudasu
konna futari waraiatte
sugoseru hi ga itsuka kuru ka na
			There were various things in the space between the two of us.
			Our hobbies are different, so we won't clean up together.
			"You're the one better at cooking, so you should do it."
			You give me those one-sided orders.
			The day when a couple like us
			Can smile and get past that will come someday.
			
okiniiri no DVD ga nai
kimi ga mata katte ni mochidashita nda
kawari ni kuria sunzen no geemu o
reberu ichi ni shite ue kaite yarou
konna koto o kurikaeshite
otagai son bakari shiteiru
			You didn't get my favorite DVD
			And went and brought back something for yourself again.
			In return, I'll take your almost-cleared game
			And overwrite it at Level 1.
			We just always repeat this kind of thing
			And both lose out in the end.
			
demo fushigi na hodo kimi o suki na mama de iru nda yo
dakara anshin shite hoshii shinu toki made issho ni iru yo
aa nani itte nda kao ga atsui!
			But I love you so much that it's strange,
			So I want you to feel at ease. We'll be together until the day we die.
			Ah, what am I saying? My face feels hot!
			
kimi ga kaettekuru no ga osoi kara
kakushiteatta keeki tabechatta yo
are? kyou atashi no tanjoubi dakke?
hitori de tabechatta namida koboreru
konna futari waraiatte
sugoseru hi ga itsuka kuru ka na
			You were getting late coming back,
			So I ate the cake that you hid.
			Eh? Today was my birthday?
			I ate it alone, and the tears spilled out.
			The day when a couple like us
			Can smile and get past that will come someday.
			
mou naku no wa gaman suru
kimi ga konbini made itte
kawari o kattekitekureru
dakara atashi waratteru yo
hora isoide yo ato juppun
			I'll control myself and not cry.
			You'll go to the convenience store
			And buy another one to replace it,
			So I'll keep on smiling.
			Come on, hurry, there are ten minutes left!
