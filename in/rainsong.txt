Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
itsu datte nakasete wa kimi o komaraseteta
sonna kimi mo ookiku nari tooku e iku tte hanashi
kiitenai! toutotsu no ame da
kasa mo naku tachitsukusu
			Always being left in tears made you worry.
			The word that the same you would grow up and go far away -
			I didn't hear that! A sudden rain comes down.
			With no umbrella, I stand still.
			
itsu demo futari de iru tte ittekureta yo ne tashika
oboeteta no wa atashi hitori datta no ka na
kimi to mita hoshi wasurete kimi to mita yume wasurete
betsubetsu no michi o susumu nante iya da
			You said that we'd always be together, I'm sure.
			Maybe I was the only one who remembered.
			Forgetting the stars that I looked at with you, forgetting the dreams that I saw with you,
			Going down a different path from yours - I don't want that.
			
moshikashite tanjoubi no purezento no koto ka na
niawanai sou itte warau kara nakushita
mitsukedasu! are wa doko da?
ame wa ikioi o masu
			Maybe it was because of that birthday present.
			"It doesn't suit me," I said and laughed, so I lost it.
			I'll find it! Where could it be?
			The rain gets stronger.
			
dou shite kimi datta ndaro ijiwaru shite bakka datta
omoidaseru no wa nasakenai kao bakkari
kimi to mita eiga wasurete kimi no nioi mo wasurete
betsu no dareka to ikiru nante iya da
			Why was it you, I wonder? I was only unkind to you.
			All I remember is your pitiful face.
			Forgetting the movies I watched with you, forgetting even your scent,
			Living with someone else - I don't want that.
			
hajimete atta hi o omoidasu
kouen no ki ni kakureteta kimi
sore o tsutsuite oidashitemita
ooame ga futteta no ni
			I remember the day I first met you.
			You were hiding under the trees in the park.
			Prodding at that, I tried driving you out,
			Even though the heavy rain was falling.
			
toki wa sugi ima wa atashi ga
ame no naka naiteiru
			Time passes, and now I'm
			Crying in the rain.
			
anna ni suki datta no ni hontou ni suki datta no ni
kimi igai no hito wa dou demo yokatta no ni
dou shite sono kimi dake ga inaku natchau ndarou
atama ga okashiku narisou da mou
ame wa tsuyoku uchitsukeru karada no shin made hieru
kouen no ki ni butsukari kimi no you ni naita
kimi ga ita koto wasurete kimi to shita koi mo wasurete
kimi no kawari ni naku no wa mou iya da...
			Even though I loved you so much, even though I truly loved you,
			Even though I didn't care about anyone but you,
			Why was it only you who disappeared?
			I feel like I'm going to go crazy.
			The rain hits me strongly, and my body is freezing to the core.
			Colliding with the trees in the park, I cried like you did.
			Forgetting that you were here, forgetting the love I shared with you,
			Crying instead of having you - I don't want that...
