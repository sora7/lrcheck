Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
aruku hohaba ga ookiku naru ni tsurete
yume kara toozakatteiku
aruku mukikaetemiru gururi mawatte
			As I start taking bigger steps
			I keep getting farther away from my dreams
			I twirled and changed direction
			
chiisana yuuki da kedo itsu demo koko ni aru yo
osanai hibi ni mitsuketa
fukai yami ni tozasareobiekitta jibunrashisa mo tsureteku yo
			Even though it's a little bravery, it's here
			I'm going to take 'myself' with 
			That I found in deep darkness
			
nagareteiku keshiki dore mo nikayottete
nandaka akubi ga deru
tsugi no doa sagashidasou sora no kanata ni
			Because all the scenery that goes by look the same
			I can't help but yawn
			I'm going to find the next 'door' up in the sky
			
chiisana fune ni notte ookina ho hirogeru yo
hareta oozora ni kaze ga fuku
kimi wa boku de itsu demo issho da kara jibunrashisa o shinjite
			I'm going to get on a small ship and release the big mast
			The wind blows in the sunny sky
			You are me and we're always together, so believe in yourself
			
kono tenohira wa nan no tame?
kewashii michi o susumu tame?
sore nara itsuka wa kanarazu
eikou to iu torofii o tsukamu!
			What are my palms for?
			Are they for going through some tough road?
			Then you'll be able to
			get a trophy in the future!
			
chiisana yuuki da kedo hontou ni chippoke da kedo
yashin ni michita sugoi yatsu
tozasareteta yami ni wa hikari ga sashi yoake no you ni kieteku
			Even though it's a small bravery, even though it's really small,
			It's filled with ambition
			Light shone in the darkness and the darkness fades away like the dawn
			
kimi wa boku de kimi mo boku de issho da kara
tabi no owari o mi ni ikou
			You are me and you are me as well and since we're all together
			Let's go see the end of everything.
