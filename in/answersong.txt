Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
taoresou da mou nanjikan gitaa hiite utatte nda
demo nakanaka ashi o tometemoraenai
nara sakendeyaru hito no kunou o ikiteiku riyuu o
dakedo kono atashi ja okogamashii sou omotchau yo
			I'm about to collapse. How long have I been playing the guitar and singing?
			But it's impossible for me to stop my feet.
			If that's case, I'll shout out the reason we live through human suffering.
			...But with me as I am, that would be arrogant  that's what I think.
			
ima mo kikoeru sono utagoe wa setsunaku mo chikarazuyoku
soko made atashi ni utaenai yo toosugite tsukamenai
			The singing voice I can hear even now is pained, yet so powerful.
			I can't sing that  it's too far away, and I can't reach it.
			
itsu no ma ni ka butai no ue ni tatteta domannaka
hirogaru shikai kankyaku bakari uzumoreteshimaisou nigero!
shiirudo ga karamitsuite ugokenai dou shiyou
kore wa mou makkou kara idomu shika nai
			Before I knew it, I was standing on the stage, right in the center.
			My spreading field of vision is filled with the audience. I feel like I'll be buried  run away!
			The shield is twisted around me, and I can't move  what should I do?
			There's nothing I can do now but face this head on.
			
utaidashi wa tochitchatta kedo B mero kara ochitsuitekita
ato wa mi o yudanete utau yo menbaa o shinjiteru yo
I want to reach you
I want to become you
koe yo hazero!
I can sing a rainbow
I can sing like the gods
ten made jump!
			My singing came out flustered, but by the second verse, I calmed down.
			After that, I entrust my whole body to my song. I believe in the band members.
			I want to reach you.
			I want to become you.
			Burst out, my voice!
			I can sing a rainbow.
			I can sing like the gods.
			Jump up to the heavens!
			
yagate suzushii kaze ga fuiteta ase mo kawaiteta
hontou ni sora no ue made kichatta you da yo
			Before long, a cool wind was blowing, and my sweat dried.
			It's like we really came all the way above the sky.
			
"ima mo kikoeteru kono utagoe wa anata no koe na nda yo
itsuka issho ni utatte mitai na
sono hi o tanoshimi ni shiteru"
			"This singing voice that I can hear now is yours, isn't it?
			Someday, I'd like to try singing with you.
			I'm looking forward to that day."
			
Such a voice was heard
Such a song was heard
un, utau yo
I shout living here
I shout friends here
sora takaku

			Such a voice was heard.
			Such a song was heard.
			Yes, I'll sing it.
			I shout living here.
			I shout with friends here,
			High up in the sky!
