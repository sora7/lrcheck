Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
kao o awashitara kenka shite bakari
sore mo ii omoide datta
			If we see each other's faces, we always fight.
			That's a good memory too.
			
kimi ga oshietekureta nda mou kowaku nai
donna fujiyuu demo shiawase wa tsukameru dakara
			You taught me that; I'm not afraid anymore.
			No matter what kind of impairment I may have, I can grasp happiness. That's why...
			
hitori demo yuku yo tatoe tsurakute mo
kimi to mita yume wa kanarazu motteku yo
kimi to ga yokatta hoka no dare demo nai
demo mezameta asa kimi wa inai nda ne
			Even if I'm alone, I'll go, even if it's difficult.
			I'll definitely bring the dream I had with you.
			I'm glad it was with you, and nobody else.
			But when I woke up in the morning, you weren't there.
			
zutto asondereru sonna ki ga shiteta
ki ga shiteita dake wakatteru
umaretekita koto mou koukai wa shinai
matsuri no ato mitai samishii kedo sorosoro ikou
			I was always playing; that's the feeling I got.
			That was just a feeling I got, that was it, I know.
			I don't regret that I was born anymore.
			Like the end of a festival, it's lonely, but we've got to go pretty soon.
			
doko made mo yuku yo koko de shitta koto
shiawase to iu yume o kanaetemiseru yo
kimi to hanarete mo donna ni tooku natte mo
atarashii asa ni atashi wa ikiru yo
			I'll go anywhere with the things I learned here.
			I'll show you that I can make the dream called happiness come true.
			Even if I'm separated from you, no matter how far away we go.
			I'm going to live in a new morning.
			
hitori demo yuku yo shinitaku natte mo
koe ga kikoeru yo shinde wa ikenai to
tatoe tsurakute mo samishisa ni naite mo
kokoro no oku ni wa nukumori o kanjiru yo
			Even if I'm alone, I'll go, even if I want to die.
			I can hear your voice, saying I shouldn't die.
			Even if it's difficult, even if I cry from loneliness
			I can feel warmth from deep inside my heart.
			
megutte nagarete toki wa utsuroi da
mou nani ga atta ka omoidasenai kedo
me o tojitemireba dareka no waraigoe
nazeka sore ga ima ichiban no takaramono
			Going round-and-round and flowing, time is ever-changing.
			I can't remember what happened anymore, but
			If I try and close my eyes, I can hear someone's laughing voice
			For some reason, now, that is My Most Precious Treasure.
