Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
furafura na mama ieji o tadotte
tsumetai heya ni korogarikomu yo
sono hashikko de nemuri ni ochiteikou
			Dizzily, I reach the road home
			And I fall down into the cold room.
			With that edge, let's fall into sleep
			
hanayaida yuuhan o hasu ni mitekita
onaka ga karappo demo ki ni shinaideita
kitto saki ni atashi dake ni sukueru mono ga
aru hazu to utatteiru
sono omoi ga atashi o tsuyoku suru muteki ni kaeru
			I saw an amazing meal from the corner of my eye.
			Even if my stomach was empty, I didn't care.
			I'm sure ahead there's something
			That only I can save, that's what I'm singing.
			Those feelings make me stronger, and make me invincible.
			
michi ni uzukumatteiru hito ga ite
hanashi o shitara atashi to nitete
sono ato wa futari de gigu ni natte
kurayami ni sakebitsuzuketa
konna koto mo aru nda yametari shinai
			There's a person squatting in the middle of the road
			And when I talk to him, he's a lot like me.
			And after that, we do a gig
			But I continued to scream from the darkness
			There are things like this; I'm not going to stop.
			
soukai ni heion o ubatteshimae
ichijikan mo nemureba daijoubu da kara
hi ga noboru made koko wa raibu suteeji
sono te ni wa kankoohii
maiku ni shite minna de utatteru
atashi mo kizamu
			At the grand opening, steal the silence away.
			Because if you sleep for even just one hour, you'll be OK.
			Until the sun rises, this is a live show.
			I take the mic,
			and I sing with everyone.
			I'll keep the beat too.
			
mayotta toki ni wa mata kono basho e modottekureba ii yo
atashi wa itsu demo utatteru kara tobisaki no wakarazu ni
			If you ever get lost, you can just come back to this place again.
			I'll always be singing, not knowing where I'm flying.
			
saa sa okaeri kimi wa mou daijoubu
			Now now, welcome home. You're all right now.
			
atatakana yuuhan ga mukaetekureru
sou iu koto kizukazu ni ikitekita ndesho?
onaka ippai tabetara mou wasuretara ii yo
			A Hot Meal will greet you home.
			You've lived your life without noticing those kind of things, right?
			Once you've eaten and you're full, just forget
			
itsu datte sakendeita makkuro na urusai karasu nado
zutto naiteru kaakaa naiteru onaka mo sukashite

			Those pure black, noisy crows that were always screaming
			Always crying, crying with a "caw caw". They're hungry too.
