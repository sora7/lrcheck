Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
haigo ni wa shatta ano kabe
yubisaki wa tetsu no nioi
susume hajike dono michi komu desho
find a way koko kara
found out mitsukeru
rock o kanadero
tooku o misuero
ikitsugi sae dekinai machi no naka
			There's a wall of shutters behind me.
			My fingertips smell like steel.
			Move ahead! Strum those strings! It's crowded, at any rate.
			Find a way from here.
			You'll find what you're looking for.
			Let's rock out and play on.
			Gaze into the distance
			Inside this city where you can't even take a breather.
			
hoshizora ga saikou no butai
karasu tachi kaakaa to naku yo
itsu mo omou yo itsu neteru n daro
find a way atashi mo
song for utau yo
rock o hibikase
crow to utau yo
			The starry sky is the best stage of them all.
			The crows cry out, "Caw, caw," above me.
			I'm always thinking of them. I wonder when they'll go to sleep.
			Find a way - I will too,
			In a song for me to sing out.
			Rock out and let it echo.
			With the crows, I'll sing out.
			
itsumade konna tokoro ni iru?
sou iu yatsu mo ita ki ga suru
urusai koto dake iu no nara
shikkoku no ha ni sarawarete kiete kure
			How long will I exist in this place?
			I feel like there were people who once said that.
			If you're only going to say annoying things,
			Let the jet black wings carry you away and just disappear.
			
zenryoku de mou taoresou da
yubi mo surikirete itai 
demo ne yaru yo konya mo biggu na sutoorii
find a way koko kara
found out mitsukeru
rock o kanadero
luck o utau yo
			With all my power, I'm about to collapse.
			My fingers are worn out and in pain,
			But, still, I'll perform. Tonight will be a big story.
			Find a way from here.
			You'll find what you're looking for.
			Let's rock out and play on.
			I'll take my luck and sing it out.
			
itsumade datte koko ni iru yo
toorisugite iku hito no naka
yami ni tozasareta suteeji de
ima kibou no uta utau yo
anata datte tsukareteru desho
sono senaka ni mo todoketai yo
konna kurayami no naka kara no
kibou terasu hikari no uta o
sono uta o
			No matter how long, I'll exist here
			Within all the people who pass through.
			On this stage enclosed in the darkness,
			I sing my poem of hope right now.
			Even you must also be tired.
			I want to send this to that back of yours -
			From within the pitch darkness,
			The song of light that gleams with hope...
			Yes, that song...
