Romaji Lyrics			Translation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mezamete ha kurikaesu nemui asa ha
eri no TAI wo kitsuku shime
kyoushitsu no DOA kuguru to honno sukoshi mune wo hatte arukidaseru
sonna nichijou ni fukinukeru kaze
kikoeta ki ga shita
kanjita ki ga shitan da
furuedasu ima kono mune de
mou kuru ki ga shita
ikuoku no hoshi ga kiesatteku no wo
miokutta
te wo futta
yokatta ne, to
			On a sleepy morning when I just fall asleep and wake again over and over
			I fasten my neck tie tightly
			I walk through the door of the classroom able to stick out my chest ever so slightly
			The wind blows right through such ordinary days
			I felt like I heard it
			Because I felt like I sensed it
			Just now, in my heart that has begun to tremble
			I felt it come again
			Some hundred million stars vanishing
			I saw them off
			Waved goodbye
			And said "Good for you"
			
rouka no sumi miorosu souji no tochuu
okashina mono da to omou
atashi no naka no toki ha tomatteru noni
chigau hibi wo ikiteru you ni
hokori ha yuki no you ni furitsumu
matteru ki ga shita
yonderu ki ga shitan da
furuedasu ima kono toki ga
mitsuketa ki ga shita
ushinawareta kioku ga yobisamashita
monogatari
eien no
sono owari
			While cleaning I looked down into the corner of the corridor
			And thought that it really was strange
			Even though the time inside of me has stopped
			I feel like each day I live is different
			And dust piles up like snow
			I felt like it was waiting for me
			Because I felt like it was calling to me
			Just now, this time that has begun to tremble
			I felt like I had found it
			The memories I lost were awoken
			This is the end
			Of my eternal
			Story
			
itsunomanika kakedashiteta
anata ni te wo hikareteta
kinou ha tooku ashita ha sugu
sonna atarimae ni koko ga odotta
			Before I knew it, I took off running
			Pulled along by your hand
			Yesterday so distant and tomorrow so close
			Naturally, it made my heart leap
			
kikoeta ki ga shita
kanjita ki ga shitan da
furuedasu ima kono mune de
mou kuru ki ga shita
ikusen no asa wo koe atarashii hi ga
matteru ki ga shita
yonderu ki ga shitan da
furueteru kono tamashii ga
mitsuketa ki ga shita
ikuoku no yume no you ni kiesareru hi wo
miokutta
te wo futta
arigatou, to
			I felt like I heard it
			Because I felt like I sensed it
			Just now, in my heart that has begun to tremble
			I felt it come again
			the new sun, crossing over a thousand mornings
			I felt like it was waiting for me
			Because I felt like it was calling to me
			My shivering spirit
			I felt like I had found it
			These days that could vanish like some hundred million dreams
			I saw them off
			Waved goodbye
			And said "thank you"
