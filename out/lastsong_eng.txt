Last Song


Ah, could you wait for just a while?
Ah, I can hear someone calling my name somewhere.

"Someday you'll be a big star,
A popular musician.
Rather than having that dream
Wouldn't it be better not to have it?
Someone chase it for me instead.
Alone, I embrace my powerlessness."

A shivering soldier
When you're like that,
Pull apart those clouds
Because I'll sing so the light gets to you
Strumming these rusted strings.

"Someday you'll have an invention breakthrough
That's Nobel Prize material.
I've already thrown out such worn-out dreams
Because it's falling into the cracks
If I could make it not wither, I'd water it."

Eyes casting-down soldier
When you're like that,
Let's let the rain
Fall in your heart.
Someday, a gold flower
Will bloom, and sway in the wind.

"There are nights I can't sleep alone, but
If someone's there, I'll get angry at that.

How pathetic.
Living is so unfortunate
No one needs someone like me.
I should just disappear."

Ah, I'm like that too.
Ah, it's hard to live, huh.
Ah, that's why I want you to listen to my song.
Ah, because I'm only singing for you.

But I have to go now.
I can't make this long
Because I've come here to leave a promise behind.
So this'll be my Last Song.
It'd be great if it helped you, even a bit.

Everyone's a soldier
A dreaming soldier
Howl up the sky above
It's fine for you not to have self-confidence
Because I'll believe in you forever.

Ah, finally, it's just you and me.
Ah, let me hear your song too.
