Highest Life


Going to pieces, I fall onto my blanket.
Why am I taking it so seriously?
Suddenly, the thought came by.

When I tried climbing up, the spreading world made me feel better as it got smaller,
So I want a wall so high that it would be reckless to climb it.
It's like everyone is looking up at me. That would be true to who I am.

On the nights when I can't fall asleep,
I like playing Clapton's music from Cream's days.
Down to the crossroads!

"I can try living on." Since I was able to think that,
It was right for me to be born, right?
I'm glad, after all, that I'm in a place where I can think that humans are beautiful now.
The compasses are lining up.

Of course, I cry at sad times;
Being by myself is lonely,
But isn't that what it is to be human?
Oh, my guitar, resound!

When I tried climbing up, the spreading world made me feel better as it got smaller,
So the more reckless the height, the better it is.
It's like everyone is looking up at me. How about you?
"I'm glad I'm alive." If you could think like that,
You'd have the greatest feeling.
Even if we're falling apart and crying, even if we're struggling and screaming,
Even so, we can start walking again.
Goodbye, and thank you.

LaLaLaLa, Happy life! Go!
LaLaLaLa, Take me with you!
LaLaLaLa, Highest life! Go!
LaLaLaLa, Go with me!
