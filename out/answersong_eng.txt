Answer Song


I'm about to collapse. How long have I been playing the guitar and singing?
But it's impossible for me to stop my feet.
If that's case, I'll shout out the reason we live through human suffering.
...But with me as I am, that would be arrogant  that's what I think.

The singing voice I can hear even now is pained, yet so powerful.
I can't sing that  it's too far away, and I can't reach it.

Before I knew it, I was standing on the stage, right in the center.
My spreading field of vision is filled with the audience. I feel like I'll be buried  run away!
The shield is twisted around me, and I can't move  what should I do?
There's nothing I can do now but face this head on.

My singing came out flustered, but by the second verse, I calmed down.
After that, I entrust my whole body to my song. I believe in the band members.
I want to reach you.
I want to become you.
Burst out, my voice!
I can sing a rainbow.
I can sing like the gods.
Jump up to the heavens!

Before long, a cool wind was blowing, and my sweat dried.
It's like we really came all the way above the sky.

"This singing voice that I can hear now is yours, isn't it?
Someday, I'd like to try singing with you.
I'm looking forward to that day."

Such a voice was heard.
Such a song was heard.
Yes, I'll sing it.
I shout living here.
I shout with friends here,
High up in the sky!
