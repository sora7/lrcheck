The Best Treasure


If we see each other's faces, we always fight.
That's a good memory too.

You taught me that; I'm not afraid anymore.
No matter what kind of impairment I may have, I can grasp happiness. That's why...

Even if I'm alone, I'll go, even if it's difficult.
I'll definitely bring the dream I had with you.
I'm glad it was with you, and nobody else.
But when I woke up in the morning, you weren't there.

I was always playing; that's the feeling I got.
That was just a feeling I got, that was it, I know.
I don't regret that I was born anymore.
Like the end of a festival, it's lonely, but we've got to go pretty soon.

I'll go anywhere with the things I learned here.
I'll show you that I can make the dream called happiness come true.
Even if I'm separated from you, no matter how far away we go.
I'm going to live in a new morning.

Even if I'm alone, I'll go, even if I want to die.
I can hear your voice, saying I shouldn't die.
Even if it's difficult, even if I cry from loneliness
I can feel warmth from deep inside my heart.

Going round-and-round and flowing, time is ever-changing.
I can't remember what happened anymore, but
If I try and close my eyes, I can hear someone's laughing voice
For some reason, now, that is My Most Precious Treasure.
