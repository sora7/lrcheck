Alchemy


I want to live forever. If I could live forever, everything would come true,
But various things drive me into a corner.
The time I have left to live, the coordinates of my dream, the place where I am -
They're all important things.
All right, let's stay here for a little and eat something sweet.
When I just stopped thinking like that, I became proud.

When I look back at the road I walked down,
I get fed up with how it's nothing but things I didn't want.
Letting the things I touch shine
that kind of path is the kind I wanted to live.

I desperately want to live. All of the days that rushed by look like they'll disappear,
But I'll try skipping class, so I shouldn't be getting tiredmy thoughts are inconsistent like that.
It's like my head was hit somewhere when I wasn't aware.
Okay, let's go to the hospital from here for a little while.
Could you leave me some medicine that'll keep me awake forever?

Just by standing up quickly,
I feel like I'm going to turn into a fossil.
As though it was forgotten by everyone,
my existence is darkening.

All right, let's stay here for a little, and I'll show you my spirit.
Slap yourself on the cheeks as proof that you exist.

I won't look back at the road I walked down.
It's all things I didn't want, but move on forward.
Letting the things I touch shine 
I'll become that kind of existence.
I'll show you that!
