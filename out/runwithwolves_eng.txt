Run with Wolves


Every night, I endure the pain that visits me on top of the squeaking, creaking bed.
Did I get something wrong? Thinking about this and that, I wallow in feelings of regret.

"The way it is now, it's no good." I don't know who said that anymore.

With the thought that all I can do now is live on alone, I gaze at the burning wasteland.
Like a wolf that endured its wounds, yeah, I don't want to disappear, not yet,
Because if I did, it would've been better if I'd fallen.

On Friday, as the weekend visits, I won't tidy up this noisy room.
Biting my nails that have grown a little long, I watch TV. At this point, everything starts to look good.
I bathed myself in alcohol from the head down. If I could get drunk from this, I'd keep on feeling good.

I don't think of the way that I can't laugh like I used to as a sad thing.
Is this just something that everyone chooses, even though it hurts so much?
In that case, it would've been better if I'd run away.

It looks like I'm going to fail, just as I predicted.
I'll just throw away the bad thoughts when I spit them out!

With the thought that all I can do now is live on alone, I gaze at the burning wasteland.
Like a wolf that endured its wounds, yeah, I don't want to disappear, not yet.
I don't think of the way that I can't laugh like I did that day as a sad thing.
The wolf that runs through the wasteland still doesn't look back even now.
In that case, let's hurry ahead and run with wolves!
