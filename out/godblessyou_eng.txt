God Bless You


With laughter being out of my character, I was listening carefully,
With my chin in my hands, to the noise of the afternoon.
As they slowly approach and then disappear,
I've just been watching the people that are like so many ripples.
If it would be conveyed even a little, I could write the meaning for why we're here.
With rain outside, I wrote my song inside the classroom.

Laugh; cry and shout; go on, all of you.
That's what I'm singing here and now.
Laugh as well as you can, like you're having fun. The continuation won't come out here.
It's already cleared up outside, but I'm here.

I've gradually gotten used to seeing these days.
Friends run along; when one falls down, everyone else laughs.
The shockingly peaceful past that we rushed our lives through
Must have been tiring. I want to rest forever...
Things aren't bad like this,
But that way, I won't achieve anything.
I want to turn this into a life with a meaning.

Laugh; cry and shout; go on; I will, too.
That's what I'm shouting here and now.
In what way do I need to spill my feelings so that I can disappear from here?
In what way do I need to forgive so that I can love those days?

"I think we can become stronger if we're together."
Words like that are weak - everyone is alone.
The autumn wind that seems to pierce through me is truly painful.
The legs that began to walk won't move forward anymore.
I want the strength to not say, "Thank you."
Someday, I'll learn how to go on without saying anything.
I'll start walking from here into all of the souls.
May God's blessings come to you. God bless you!

Laugh; cry and shout; when it's time for you to go.
I was standing completely still, all alone.
All alone, for just a little longer, I'll cry, I'll laugh,
On my way to days different from that one.
