23:50


There were various things in the space between the two of us.
Our hobbies are different, so we won't clean up together.
"You're the one better at cooking, so you should do it."
You give me those one-sided orders.
The day when a couple like us
Can smile and get past that will come someday.

You didn't get my favorite DVD
And went and brought back something for yourself again.
In return, I'll take your almost-cleared game
And overwrite it at Level 1.
We just always repeat this kind of thing
And both lose out in the end.

But I love you so much that it's strange,
So I want you to feel at ease. We'll be together until the day we die.
Ah, what am I saying? My face feels hot!

You were getting late coming back,
So I ate the cake that you hid.
Eh? Today was my birthday?
I ate it alone, and the tears spilled out.
The day when a couple like us
Can smile and get past that will come someday.

I'll control myself and not cry.
You'll go to the convenience store
And buy another one to replace it,
So I'll keep on smiling.
Come on, hurry, there are ten minutes left!
