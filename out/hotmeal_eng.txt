Hot Meal (Another "Thousand Enemies")


Dizzily, I reach the road home
And I fall down into the cold room.
With that edge, let's fall into sleep

I saw an amazing meal from the corner of my eye.
Even if my stomach was empty, I didn't care.
I'm sure ahead there's something
That only I can save, that's what I'm singing.
Those feelings make me stronger, and make me invincible.

There's a person squatting in the middle of the road
And when I talk to him, he's a lot like me.
And after that, we do a gig
But I continued to scream from the darkness
There are things like this; I'm not going to stop.

At the grand opening, steal the silence away.
Because if you sleep for even just one hour, you'll be OK.
Until the sun rises, this is a live show.
I take the mic,
and I sing with everyone.
I'll keep the beat too.

If you ever get lost, you can just come back to this place again.
I'll always be singing, not knowing where I'm flying.

Now now, welcome home. You're all right now.

A Hot Meal will greet you home.
You've lived your life without noticing those kind of things, right?
Once you've eaten and you're full, just forget

Those pure black, noisy crows that were always screaming
Always crying, crying with a "caw caw". They're hungry too.
