Thousand Enemies


Passing the time with you when you're in a bad mood,
There's one thing that I've learned.
You're just pretending to be like that and desperately fighting.
Don't ever change like the ice does.
Even if the summer sun's rays are hot, don't melt away.
I'm sure that just ahead, there's a beautiful glacier.
That kind of heart with a shape  if they'd realize it, all people have them. You have one too!

Hungry and unable to keep on walking,
There's one thing that I've learned.
I'm putting off the things I should do and just doing what I want.
I'll eat my food and get ready to fight!
I want to have this forever  as strong as steel,
A stubborn spirit that won't let anything through.
I'm sure that even now, it's in the middle of standing still and defending.
On the path ahead, there are countless enemies
That are waiting for me. They're waiting for you, too!

When we're lost, I want you to show me the map in your heart.
In that case, we'll know the way to go soon.
I just can't figure it out alone.

Come on, let's move ahead across any number of bridges.
We'll always be together like lovers,
So even if the summer sun's rays are hot, we won't be apart.
I'm sure that just ahead, a magnificent landscape awaits.
When that time comes, I'll listen to all of those feelings you've gathered.
I have those too. I'll tell you about them, too. I'll tell them all to you!
