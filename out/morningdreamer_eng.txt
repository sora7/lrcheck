Morning Dreamer


The alarm clock is ringing loudly in my ears.
Please, let me sleep for a little more.
At the drinking party after yesterday's gig,
I couldn't drink alcohol, of course, but I had juice. Still...
I'm living seriously through busy days.
So somehow, let this kind of me sleep...
When I actually get up, I'll let you hear the new song.
Of course, when I sing and play, the harmony is all yours.
I'll teach you as attentively as I can, so don't you worry.
Ah, right, I broke a string. Go out and buy some, please!

It's been half an hour since I stopped the alarm clock.
I really have to get it together and get up, though.
A futon in midwinter is a devilish item.
I just can't get out of it now. This thing has a sleeping curse on it.
In the modern society that we live in,
There was a demon in this place.
I'm good for nothing, so I put on a smile  isn't that terrible?
Maybe from here, things will get more interesting, right?
That's why even though I was told to continue, I haven't come up.
For now, I'll get eaten by the futon and become a futon bun.
Now, isn't that nice?

Okay, okay, I'll get up soon. Heat the bath for me.
I'll put my half-eaten cookie in my wake-up coffee.
Ah, right, I was going to practice the new song, wasn't I?
Anyway, who have I been talking to when I live alone?
