Crow Song


There's a wall of shutters behind me.
My fingertips smell like steel.
Move ahead! Strum those strings! It's crowded, at any rate.
Find a way from here.
You'll find what you're looking for.
Let's rock out and play on.
Gaze into the distance
Inside this city where you can't even take a breather.

The starry sky is the best stage of them all.
The crows cry out, "Caw, caw," above me.
I'm always thinking of them. I wonder when they'll go to sleep.
Find a way - I will too,
In a song for me to sing out.
Rock out and let it echo.
With the crows, I'll sing out.

How long will I exist in this place?
I feel like there were people who once said that.
If you're only going to say annoying things,
Let the jet black wings carry you away and just disappear.

With all my power, I'm about to collapse.
My fingers are worn out and in pain,
But, still, I'll perform. Tonight will be a big story.
Find a way from here.
You'll find what you're looking for.
Let's rock out and play on.
I'll take my luck and sing it out.

No matter how long, I'll exist here
Within all the people who pass through.
On this stage enclosed in the darkness,
I sing my poem of hope right now.
Even you must also be tired.
I want to send this to that back of yours -
From within the pitch darkness,
The song of light that gleams with hope...
Yes, that song...
