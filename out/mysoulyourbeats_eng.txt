My Soul, Your Beats!


On a sleepy morning when I just fall asleep and wake again over and over
I fasten my neck tie tightly
I walk through the door of the classroom able to stick out my chest ever so slightly
The wind blows right through such ordinary days
I felt like I heard it
Because I felt like I sensed it
Just now, in my heart that has begun to tremble
I felt it come again
Some hundred million stars vanishing
I saw them off
Waved goodbye
And said "Good for you"

While cleaning I looked down into the corner of the corridor
And thought that it really was strange
Even though the time inside of me has stopped
I feel like each day I live is different
And dust piles up like snow
I felt like it was waiting for me
Because I felt like it was calling to me
Just now, this time that has begun to tremble
I felt like I had found it
The memories I lost were awoken
This is the end
Of my eternal
Story

Before I knew it, I took off running
Pulled along by your hand
Yesterday so distant and tomorrow so close
Naturally, it made my heart leap

I felt like I heard it
Because I felt like I sensed it
Just now, in my heart that has begun to tremble
I felt it come again
the new sun, crossing over a thousand mornings
I felt like it was waiting for me
Because I felt like it was calling to me
My shivering spirit
I felt like I had found it
These days that could vanish like some hundred million dreams
I saw them off
Waved goodbye
And said "thank you"
