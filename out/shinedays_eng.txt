Shine Days


I've already forgotten the dream I had yesterday,
But my heart is still beating so fast.
I'll try cramming all of the coins into my pocket.
Let's click our heels and get out of this cramped room.

Come on, run on through yesterday and today. To the future we haven't seen yet, go!
Let's go start a revolution. Let's go make our dreams come true!
Once we run out there, let's go anywhere.
Let's break down Einstein's theories and push on forward.

A traveler I met on a sunny day said
That past here, there's only a vast wasteland.
More importantly, I want to wash these mud-covered shoes
Because we're always together.

Come on, from here, it's a contest with yourself. Even if it's with yourself, you'll grow!
We'll always get hungry just like kids!
If we can, let's follow our hearts. Let's draw great map.
The end depends on us -- it's infinite.

No matter what kind of day comes, I'll hold up this fist.
I am sunshine, shining through the gaps in the clouds -
A soft and gentle beam!

Indecisive people will be left behind.
Right over there, I'll predict our chances of winning.

Come on, run on through yesterday and today. To the future we haven't seen yet, go!
We're going to start a revolution. Are you ready to go, baby?
If we're all sure, we'll go with no confusion in our minds.
We'll break down Einstein's theories and push on forward.
We are all dazzling sunshine!
Let's go, monster sunshine!
I'll get you all fired up!
We are sunshine, shining through the gaps in the clouds -
Light that can make dreams come true. Shine days!
