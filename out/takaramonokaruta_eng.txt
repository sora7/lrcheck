My Most Precious Treasure


If the cuffs of my pants get wet,
I can just wait until they dry.
Making sounds in the water, I jumped in.

You taught me this. I'm not afraid anymore.
I have to let go of this hand that was holding on to mine.

Even alone, I'll go on, even if it's painful.
I'll definitely take along the dream I saw with you.
It's nice to be with everyone; I was glad to be with everyone.
...But in the morning I woke up to, none of you are there.

If I look back now, not even a shadow is there.
Only a small pool of water was shining.
To live on is to stand and fight.
Once you understand that, all you need is the courage to step forward.

I'll go anywhere with the things that I learned here.
I'll show that I can make the dream called happiness come true.
Even if we're apart, no matter how far apart we become,
I will live on in a new morning.

Even alone, I'll go on. Even if I start to want to die,
I'll hear your voice telling me that I must not die.
Even if it's painful, even if darkness closes me in,
Deep in my heart, the lights will remain bright.

Turning and flowing along, time is transient.
What happened then? I can't remember,
But if I try closing my eyes, I hear everyone's laughing voices.
For some reason, that is now my most precious treasure.
