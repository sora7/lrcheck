Little Braver


As I start taking bigger steps
I keep getting farther away from my dreams
I twirled and changed direction

Even though it's a little bravery, it's here
I'm going to take 'myself' with 
That I found in deep darkness

Because all the scenery that goes by look the same
I can't help but yawn
I'm going to find the next 'door' up in the sky

I'm going to get on a small ship and release the big mast
The wind blows in the sunny sky
You are me and we're always together, so believe in yourself

What are my palms for?
Are they for going through some tough road?
Then you'll be able to
get a trophy in the future!

Even though it's a small bravery, even though it's really small,
It's filled with ambition
Light shone in the darkness and the darkness fades away like the dawn

You are me and you are me as well and since we're all together
Let's go see the end of everything.
