Rain Song


Always being left in tears made you worry.
The word that the same you would grow up and go far away -
I didn't hear that! A sudden rain comes down.
With no umbrella, I stand still.

You said that we'd always be together, I'm sure.
Maybe I was the only one who remembered.
Forgetting the stars that I looked at with you, forgetting the dreams that I saw with you,
Going down a different path from yours - I don't want that.

Maybe it was because of that birthday present.
"It doesn't suit me," I said and laughed, so I lost it.
I'll find it! Where could it be?
The rain gets stronger.

Why was it you, I wonder? I was only unkind to you.
All I remember is your pitiful face.
Forgetting the movies I watched with you, forgetting even your scent,
Living with someone else - I don't want that.

I remember the day I first met you.
You were hiding under the trees in the park.
Prodding at that, I tried driving you out,
Even though the heavy rain was falling.

Time passes, and now I'm
Crying in the rain.

Even though I loved you so much, even though I truly loved you,
Even though I didn't care about anyone but you,
Why was it only you who disappeared?
I feel like I'm going to go crazy.
The rain hits me strongly, and my body is freezing to the core.
Colliding with the trees in the park, I cried like you did.
Forgetting that you were here, forgetting the love I shared with you,
Crying instead of having you - I don't want that...
